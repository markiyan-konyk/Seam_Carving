# Seam_Carving

When compiled the program takes in a .bin image and reduced the width of the image without distorting important features (of course if you reduce enough it will deform), and return an output .bin image with the reduced size, you can then use a bin to bmp to get to see the image.

### Instructions

The code posted in this repository takes an "image.bin", reduces the width by 200 pixels, and outputs output.bin. If you want to change the names, or the amount reduced you can change it in the main function of seamcarving.c, and don't forget to compile :)
